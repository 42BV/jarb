1.3
	- Improved the 'populator' module
		- Created a 'revertable database updater' interface, allowing users to define a database update that can be reverted.
		  All common updater components, such as composite and conditional, provide support for reverting behaviour.
		- Database updating listener now has an 'initializeAndRevert' constructor method that invokes revert() on close.
		- Created a 'class name database updater' component that can create a spring-context aware updater bean on demand.
		  Also added an 'on classpath' condition to prevent unknown class exceptions.

1.2
	- Refactored the 'validation' module
